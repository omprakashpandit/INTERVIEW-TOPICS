=>WebService is a technology which is used to develop distributed application.
========================
WebService Architecture
========================
1.Provider:-the application which is providing business services to other applications is called as Provider.
2.Consumer:-the application which is accessing business services from other applications is called as Consumer. 
3.WSDL:-WSDL stands "Webservices Description Language". it contains provider details. WSDL is an XML.
4.SOAP:-SOAP stands "Simple Object Access Protocol".SOAP acts as payload carrier between consumer & provider.SOAP is XML.
5.UDDI:-UDDI is a registry where WSDL files will be stored.(outdated)


Webservices : (We can expose our services to users)
---------------------------------------------------
1. SOAP
   -> SOAP protocol
   -> XML MediaType 
   -> secure
   -> Design is complex 
        WSDL
        Wsdl2Java
        pojo
        stub -> call the method
2. REST
   -> HTTP , HTTPS 
   -> XML , JSOn , TEXT , HTMl Any mediatype 
   -> Secure (Token base auth)
   -> Design Easy
      create method and define HTTP method type
      define the URL (user access url)

3. Layer Architecture (industry standard)
